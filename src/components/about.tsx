                    ðŸ’» Coding is not just a jobâ€”it&apos;s my passion. With 5+ years
                    of experience in Fullstack Development, I thrive on crafting
                    high-performance web applications that deliver real value.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    ðŸ”¥ My expertise lies in ReactJS, NextJS, and NodeJS,
                    allowing me to build modern, scalable solutions. Currently,
                    I&apos;m expanding my skills in Backend & DevOps to master the
                    entire development lifecycleâ€”from system architecture to
                    deployment and optimization.
                    <br />
                    <br />I believe that technology never stops evolving, and
                    neither do I. I&apos;m always learning, innovating, and pushing
                    boundaries to create better, faster, and smarter digital
                    experiences. ðŸš€ .
